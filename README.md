# Encapsulating-Triangle-Sides

In the Encapsulating Triangle Sides, we have implemented a simple class that consisted of nothing but static methods. There is a class named "Triangle" that represents proper triangles. (A "proper" triangle has positive side lengths and a nonzero area.) To accomplish this, the class has three double instance variables. Each object of the class has its own copy of these variables that it uses to store the side lengths of a particular triangle.
